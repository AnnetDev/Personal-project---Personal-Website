## Reflection  

### What did you learn during this project?  
During this project, I refreshed my existing knowledge in HTML and CSS, learned to use AI tools for creating design concepts (for example, with Figma Make) and for structuring parts of the project. I also experimented with animations — both SVG and CSS keyframes. Additionally, I explored testing and validation workflows: I checked my site with W3C validators, fixed issues, and used Lighthouse to improve performance, accessibility, and SEO — aiming for the best possible scores.

### What was your biggest challenge, and how did you approach it?  
My biggest challenge was dealing with perfectionism and self-criticism, especially during the design process. I often felt unsatisfied with my work. The way I approached this was by reminding myself that complete satisfaction is unrealistic and that being critical of my own work is part of my nature. Accepting this helped me move forward.

Another significant challenge was ensuring consistent behavior across different browsers and devices (desktop, iOS, and Android). Some animations behaved unpredictably depending on the platform. To solve this, I researched solutions online, tested thoroughly after deployment, asked AI tools for suggestions, and experimented until I found stable fixes

### If you were ever stuck while working on your project, how did you get unstuck?  
I often got stuck while working on design elements, constantly searching for the “best” version. What helped me was task prioritization: I tried to realistically evaluate how much time I was spending on polishing one small detail. Even AI couldn’t always solve this problem — the real solution was acceptance and understanding that my subjective view made me see flaws that others might not notice.

In technical cases (like browser-specific animation issues), I relied on debugging tools, documentation, and community resources. Combining multiple approaches — reading, experimenting, and validating — helped me move forward.

### What are you most proud of in your site?  
I’m proud that I tried out new CSS tricks and managed to implement techniques I found in resources like CodePen. I also created a theme switcher for my site, which was something new for me. I’m proud that I validated my code, tested my project thoroughly across devices, and pushed myself to improve accessibility and SEO to reach top Lighthouse scores.

Most importantly, I’m glad that now I have a personal website that represents me as a developer. In the future, I plan to improve and even rewrite it using new technologies. But now I already have a solid base and concept, which means further improvements will be much easier since a lot of groundwork has been done.

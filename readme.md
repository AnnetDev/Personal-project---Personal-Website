## Reflection  

### What did you learn during this project?  
During this project, I refreshed my existing knowledge in HTML, CSS, learned how to use AI tools for creating design concepts (for example, with Figma Make) and even for structuring parts of the project. I also experimented with animations — both SVG and CSS keyframes.  

### What was your biggest challenge, and how did you approach it?  
My biggest challenge was dealing with perfectionism and self-criticism, especially during the design process. I often felt unsatisfied with my work. The way I approached this was by reminding myself that complete satisfaction is unrealistic and that being critical of my own work is part of my nature. Accepting this helped me move forward.  

### If you were ever stuck while working on your project, how did you get unstuck?  
I often got stuck while working on design elements, constantly searching for the “best” version. What helped me was task prioritization: I tried to realistically evaluate how much time I was spending on polishing one small detail. Even AI couldn’t always solve this problem — the real solution was acceptance and understanding that my subjective view made me see flaws that others might not notice.  

### What are you most proud of in your site?  
I’m proud that I tried out new CSS tricks and managed to implement techniques I found in resources like CodePen. I also created a theme switcher for my site, which was something new for me. Overall, I’m happy that I wasn’t afraid to experiment and explore new approaches in my project.
